## Summary

The SYD PYpline -> asteroseismic SYD pipeline ([Huber et al. 2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009CoAst.160...74H/abstract)) originally written in IDL translated into python for all your automated asteroseismic needs.

The pipeline works in two major parts (and one minor part):

1) findex: automatically finds power excess due to solar-like oscillations using a frequency resolved collapsed autocorrelation function
2) fitbg: perform a fit to the granulation background and measures the frequency of maximum power (nu_max), the large frequency separation (Delta_nu) and oscillation amplitude
3) scrape_output: concatenates results from the two submodules for each individual target into a single csv in Files/

## File Overview

### Files/

- todo.txt: File containing IDs of stars to be processed 
- data/: Directory containing data to be processed. File format: ID_LC.txt (lightcurve: days versus fractional flux) and ID_PS.txt (power spectrum: muHz versus ppm^2 muHz^-1). 
- params_findex.txt: input parameters for findex module (detailed documentation coming)
- params_fitbg.txt: input parameters fot fitbg module (detailed documentation coming)
- star_info.csv: basic information on stars to be processed. If no estimate of numax is provided, the stellar parameters are used to calculate as estimate
- results/target/: Directory containing result plots and files for each target

### Code

- functions.py : models, distributions, ffts, smoothing functions are all in this file
- SYD.py : initiates SYD through main
- scrape_output.py : grabs each individual target's results and concatenates results into a single csv in Files/ for each submodulel (i.e. findex.csv and globalpars.csv). This is automatically called at the end of the main SYD module.

Documentation and code under construction.

## Example

To run example code clone/download the repository and then do:

- python SYD.py

This will run the pipeline on the two stars specified in the todo.txt file (KIC1435467 and KIC2309595), one star at a time first using the findex module followed by the fitbg module. If you'd like to skip findex (e.g. useful for a handful of high S/N stars where you can visually estimate nu_max and thus specify it manually in star_info.csv), set findex = False in SYD.py. 

Note: for multiple targets in todo.txt, the text and plot outputs are suppressed. To override this default and see the output in real time, simply run this command instead:

- python SYD.py -i

## Multiprocessing

If you would like to use multiprocessing for a large number of targets and are running MacOSX Mojave, High Sierra, or Catalina, you must do the following before it will execute:

1) Add 'export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES' to the TOP of your bashrc or zshrc file (or bash_profile - whichever you use).
2) Close all terminal windows, reopen and it should work.

If you do not do this, you will see some version of the error for n threads:

objc[4182]: +[__NSPlaceholderDictionary initialize] may have been in progress in another thread when fork() was called. We cannot safely call it or ignore it in the fork() child process. Crashing instead. Set a breakpoint on objc_initializeAfterForkError to debug.
